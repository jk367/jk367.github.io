So, this is my first post on the website. I will keep it short and try to cover the reasons why I want to start writing again, why I'm hosting the website myself, and finally, what I'm planning to get out of this.

**Who are you, and why should I care about what you have to say?**

Well, I'm James Kettle, a senior (about to graduate) at Columbia. I make software, I read a lot, and write about things that are of interest to me. You don't have to care about what I say; the blog is mostly for me to write out my thoughts in a clearer way.

**Why is this on your website and not on a WordPress/Substack/etc?**

I think it's really important for all writers to have a website that they made themselves and that they host. I'm also going to post every article on Substack because I think it's the best platform right now, but that could change! So, I am building out this website; also, it's fun to build stuff.

**Why are you doing this?**

Well, I need a job, and people said having a website is a good place to start. Also, I am almost done with college, so it will be good to keep up writing after I am done taking classes that force me to. Also, I hope to write things that will be helpful to others (this could be a stretch).

**Ok, how often are you going to do this?**

Not sure, ideally every week, maybe more if I have the time, but I won't put out content that I find bad just to keep up.

Now that the small Q&A is over, I hope you have a better understanding of what I am trying to do. Also, I will not be using any GPTs to write the content, this is more of a mental workout than a content machine. I hope you enjoy the rest of the website.
