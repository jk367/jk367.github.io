I'm a writer and programmer currently living in Tbilisi, Georgia.

I'm from New York. I went to Brooklyn Technical Highschool, and then Columbia and Sciences Po. In college I studied Economics, Sociology, and CS. I have worked at a hegde fund, a consulting group, and at a major institution, which were all fine, but I decided to become a Math Teacher in Tbilisi for a year because I thought it would be more intresting. This website is an attempt to get better at front end programming, design, and writing. 

I'm looking for work starting either Jan 2024 or May 2024, so this site also operates as a resume and portfolio. 

You can find all my writings on this website, or on my [Substack](https://substack.com/@jameskettle?utm_source=user-menu) 

You can find my coding projects on my [github](https://github.com/jk367)

You can also find [my resume here](/resume_james.pdf)
