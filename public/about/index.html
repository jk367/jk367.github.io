<p>Hi my name is James Kettle.
Some things about me that are good to know:
I am from NYC, and went to Brooklyn Tech.
I lived in France for two years for college.
I went to Columbia for Infromation science (kinda a mix of CS and social Science).
I really like music, and I make/preform it.
I do a lot of programming and looking for work after school.
I&rsquo;m moving to Tblisi for a few months after college but Jan 2024 can relocate where ever.
