    <h1>James Kettle</h1>
    <p>I&rsquo;m a writer and programmer currently living in Tbilisi, Georgia.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m from New York. I went to Brooklyn Technical Highschool, and then Columbia and Sciences Po. In college I studied Economics, Sociology, and CS. I have worked at a hegde fund, a consulting group, and at a major institution, which were all fine, but I decided to become a Math Teacher in Tbilisi for a year because I thought it would be more intresting. This website is an attempt to get better at front end programming, design, and writing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for work starting either Jan 2024 or May 2024, so this site also operates as a resume and portfolio.</p>
<p>You can find all my writings on this website, or on my <a href="https://substack.com/@jameskettle?utm_source=user-menu">Substack</a></p>
<p>You can find my coding projects on my <a href="https://github.com/jk367">github</a></p>
<p>You can also find <a href="/resume_james.pdf">my resume here</a></p>
<p>Feel free to reach out: Jameskettle2018 at gmail.com</p>
