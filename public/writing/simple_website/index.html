    <h1>A Simple Website</h1>
    <p>If you take a look at this website, it is very simple. I made my personal website as simple and as fast as possible. I did this because I have noticed a pretty reliable trend where the more polished or attractive the homepage of someone is, the higher the chance that person is a grifter. I am not a grifter. I want my ideas and my work to be displayed simply so that someone can easily take away everything they could need.</p>
<p>This is not to say that my website is not expanding or improving. On the contrary, I&rsquo;m looking at ways to improve this site every day, incorporating features that I have seen online and information that I think will benefit people that come across it.</p>
<p>By making this website purely from scratch, I&rsquo;m learning how to build from nothing, to consider every design choice possible, and to choose what is right for me. In the age of AI, we are going to give up a lot of agency and have AI models do a lot of work for us. This will most likely be a good thing as it frees up our minds and allows us to step away from the minutiae. However, I want the minutiae. I want this site to be mine, and only mine. I didn&rsquo;t use any previous layouts; this is just Hugo, HTML, and CSS.</p>
<p>For me, there is a beauty and simplicity in the classic HTML wall of text. It says: &ldquo;Here is me, here is what I have to say&rdquo;, and that&rsquo;s exactly why I made this site.</p>
