    <h1>A Georgian Sketchbook #0: Before we fly.</h1>
    <p>This is the first article of my series on my travels and interviews in Georgia.</p>
<p>There are times when places speak to you more than words. They speak a language that can&rsquo;t be translated or understood by anyone else but you. Not everyone is lucky enough to have a place that speaks to them; some are so fortunate that they can have a conversation with every place they visit. I&rsquo;m lucky that I found one. Tbilisi, a knuckle-sized capital city in the heart of the Caucasus region, has some profoundly unfriendly neighbors around it. It&rsquo;s filled to the brim with polluted air, terrible drivers, and the most incredible people you probably will never meet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 2020, the last night of my week-long trip to Georgia. The bags under my eyes are concerning. I&rsquo;m so hungover I can&rsquo;t even think straight. I&rsquo;m seated outside of a bar at a wooden table with several new Georgian friends. The night is just starting; the air is polluted and smoky, as it often is in Tbilisi. I have just met all of these people, but it feels like I&rsquo;ve lived here my whole life. We drink disgustingly strong liquor, they start singing Georgian folk songs, and they start teaching me to dance. I stand up with a glass of amber wine, and toast. I rant about how much I love this country, how much I love these people, and how I will be back. Everyone drinks, everyone laughs, everyone says they will see me soon. When I sat back down, some part of me thought that I was lying, that this would be my first and last trip to Georgia. That I would be collecting stories for the future water cooler, and I would just never get the chance again to visit. That part of me was wrong.</p>
<p>Georgia is a small country, half the size of the US state with the same name, with a third of the population. Unlike other diaspora communities, there aren&rsquo;t many Georgians in the world, around 4 million, almost all of whom live in Georgia or in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>If you do see or read about Georgia, it will most likely be about three things: how Russia will be invading, the funny Khachapuri cheese boats, or being a cheap country to be a digital nomad in.</p>
<p>I grew up around Georgians, Russians, and Ukrainians, so when I see all the content online about Georgia just being reduced to a cheap post-Soviet co-working space, I get annoyed and disappointed. Georgia is so much more than just its food, its nature, or a place to work in. While the food is amazing, the nature beautiful, and it&rsquo;s a great place to work in, Georgia is its people.</p>
<p>Georgians are gargantuan in their generosity and portions, the fastest talkers, drivers, or dancers you will ever meet. They are the only people to pick you up on the side of the road, give you the shirt off their back, take you to a feast, then a techno club. Georgians are emotional, natural political debaters and protestors, ready at the drop of a dime to flood the street and demand justice for their language, people, or land. It&rsquo;s hard to understand Georgians when all you see are their cheese boats or low taxes, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m starting this blog.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s June 2023, I have just graduated from college, and I&rsquo;m going to be a math teacher for a year in Tbilisi before starting a more conventional job. It might be crazy to leave NYC for Tbilisi, but when you hear a call to your heart, you have an obligation to answer it. While I&rsquo;m there,I will be telling the stories of Georgians from all backgrounds - rich, poor, famous, unknown, left, right, young, and old. I will be telling their stories and creating a clearer picture of the Georgia that I know for people who are willing to listen. I hope to give my readers a slice of this wonderfully crazy country.</p>
<p>I arrive on July 8, and thus will be the first page of my Georgian Sketchbook.</p>
