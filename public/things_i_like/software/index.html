    <h1>Software</h1>
    <p>As a person who codes, and did a degree in computer science (minor), I really think most software is really bad. However, here is some software I really love.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.ableton.com">Ableton</a> I make music, and I truly think the best music software is ableton. I think ableton is probably the best made software that I use. Its the only software where I would pay 50% for it and still would feel like that would be a fair price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="freedom.to">Freedom</a> Im addicted to the internet, I have tried many ways to break the addiction, including onesec, turning my phone black and white, but freedom is the best system I have used. Premium is also worth it because of the Locked mode. Their model is also great, 7 free sessions, then you decide to buy, an anti-dark partern.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://chat.openai.com">ChatGPT</a> chatGPT is the only AI tool I use, perhaps with exception of Pi, almost all other tools are over engineered gpt wrappers.</p>
