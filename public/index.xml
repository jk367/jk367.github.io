      <title>A Simple Website</title>

      <description>If you take a look at this website, it is very simple. I made my personal website as simple and as fast as possible. I did this because I have noticed a pretty reliable trend where the more polished or attractive the homepage of someone is, the higher the chance that person is a grifter. I am not a grifter. I want my ideas and my work to be displayed simply so that someone can easily take away everything they could need.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s July 11. It&amp;rsquo;s a misty morning in Tbilisi. The weather is much cooler than it was for the past few days. Tbilisi in the summer can be unbearably hot. There&amp;rsquo;s a light rain and slight fog that gently drapes over mountains that surround the city.
Tbilisi is amazing. Tbilisi is chaotic. Tbilisi is hard to understand. I understand why I wanted to come here. For Westerners, the city feels mostly like a typical European city.</description>

      <description>This is the first article of my series on my travels and interviews in Georgia.
There are times when places speak to you more than words. They speak a language that can&amp;rsquo;t be translated or understood by anyone else but you. Not everyone is lucky enough to have a place that speaks to them; some are so fortunate that they can have a conversation with every place they visit. I&amp;rsquo;m lucky that I found one.</description>

      <description>Hi, my name is James Kettle. I&amp;rsquo;m a writer and programmer currently living in Tbilisi, Georgia.
Background I went to Columbia and Sciences Po (â€˜23) and have two degrees, one in Economics and one in Information Science (a mix of Sociology and CS). I have worked at BlackRock, Plural Strategy Consulting, a school in France, and an NGO called Impact Jeunes in Marseille. After I graduated in May 2023, I decided to move to Georgia and become a math teacher at the Georgian American School.</description>
